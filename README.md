#mapsforge Titanium module
This module wraps parts of the, not yet released, [mapsforge](https://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/) 0.4.0 (0.4.0-SNAPSHOT) API. Specifically it is using the ["rewrite"](https://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/source/browse/?name=rewrite) branch of the mapsforge API. Note, that is API is **not** production ready and is unsupported.
Just as mapsforge, this module is in development.

#Usage
See the example app in "/example" for an overview of how this module can be used.

#Doc
JavaDoc documentation for the proxy can be found [here](http://snowciety.github.io/sc.mapsforge/sc/mapsforge/MapsforgeViewProxy.html#method_summary). This documentation together with the example application should hopefully give some insight on how the module is to be used.
